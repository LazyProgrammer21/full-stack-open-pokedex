CI/CD for JAVA

We are a team of 10 people working on ecommerce web app which is almost complete and will be released soon. We are using java language.
In production, to automate the version control of the product, files uploading to the server, team management, testing and expansion of the software, manually is really a pain So, we use CI/CD system. Depending upon the development tools and language, there are different tools and techniques for CI/CD.

Lint: In this step we need to keep code clean and maintainable There are various tools for linting in java, very popular and widely used linting tool is discussed below:
Checkstykle: Its one of the most popular linters available with regular updates, thorough documentation and ample community support. It works natively with Ant and CLI and also available as a plugin for wide variety of IDE’s and toolset.

Testing: In this step, we ensure existing feature doesn’t breaks. JUnit is widely used testing tool for unit testing in java.The unit test is used in a path function or for testing a small piece of code. It plays a vital role in test-driven development and is a part of the collective unit test frameworks called xUnit. Besides, it is open source, early bug finder and better for test driven Development.

Building: We put all our code together to make a complete working software. Most widely used
Project management tool is maven or gradle. I have used maven tool for building.
a. Maven: It is loaded with many features, which are listed below:

1. Easy setup using best practise.
2. Dependency management with automatic update.
3. Automatic parent versioning
4. Backwards computational with previous versions.

Alternative to Jenkins and Github Actions.

For a java project, we are using maven for project management. To setup CI, we used Maven as a alternatives to jenkins because of the following reasons:
a. Maven provides a comprehensive set of build, test and deploy tools.
b. Offers a built in facilities to package application for both java-based artifacts and docker images so that a team members can test and deploy into a kubernetes cluster.

Various aspects should be kept in mind while choosing the self-hosted or cloud based environment

1. Managing infrstructure
2. Security and Trust
3. Integrations
4. Expenses
